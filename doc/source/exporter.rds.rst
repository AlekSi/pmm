|amazon-rds| Exporter (rds_exporter)
================================================================================

The |amazon-rds| exporter makes the |amazon-cloudwatch| metrics available to
|pmm|. |pmm| uses this exporter to obtain metrics from any |amazon-rds| node
that you choose to monitor.

Metrics
================================================================================

The |amazon-rds| exporter has two types of metrics: basic and advanced. To be
able to use advanced metrics, make sure to set the
|gui.enable-enhanced-monitoring| option in the settings of your |amazon-rds| DB
instance.

      :Units: Count
   
      T2 instances only. The number of CPU credits available for the instance to burst
      beyond its base CPU utilization. Credits are stored in the credit balance
      after they are earned and removed from the credit balance after they
      expire. Credits expire 24 hours after they are earned. CPU credit metrics are
      available only at a 5 minute frequency. 
   
   aws_rds_cpu_credit_usage_average (Basic rds_exporter metric)

      CPU credit equals one vCPU running at 100 percent utilization for one
      minute or an equivalent combination of vCPUs, utilization, and time (for
      example, one vCPU running at 50 percent utilization for two minutes or two
      vCPUs running at 25 percent utilization for two minutes). CPU credit
      metrics are available only at a 5 minute frequency. If you specify a
      period greater than five minutes, use the Sum statistic instead of the
      Average statistic.
