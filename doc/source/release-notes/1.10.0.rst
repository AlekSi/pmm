Annotations: Record and Display Application Events
================================================================================

:Jira Ticket ID: :pmmbug:`2330`

In this release, |pmm| provides the |pmm-admin.annotate| command to enable
receiving events and displaying them as |grafana| annotations.

By displaying application events on top of your |pmm| graphs, engineers can now
correlate application events to database events (common cases: application
deploys, outages, and upgrades) against database and system level metric
changes.

|grafana| 5.0: Improved Presentation of Graphs
================================================================================

:Jira Ticket ID: :pmmbug:`2332`

|grafana| 5.0 is no longer bound by panel constraints to keep all objects at the
same fixed height.  This improvement indirectly addresses the visualization
error in |pmm-server| where some graphs would appear to be on two lines and
ended up wasting screen space.

Switch Between Dashboards While Maintaining the Same Host
================================================================================

:Jira Ticket ID: :pmmbug:`2371`

|pmm| now allows you to navigate between dashboards while maintaining the same
host under observation, so that, for example, you can start on |mysql-overview|
looking at host **serverA**, switch to the |mysql-innodb-metrics-advanced| dashboard
and continue looking at **serverA**, thus saving you a few clicks in the interface.

PXC Galera Replication Latency: Compare Latency Across All Members in a Cluster
================================================================================

:Jira Ticket ID: :pmmbug:`2295`

We have added new PXC Replication Latency graphs on our
|pxc-galera-cluster-overview| dashboard so that you can compare latency across
all members in a cluster in one view.
