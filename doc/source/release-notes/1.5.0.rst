Percona Monitoring and Management |release|
================================================================================

:Date: November 23, 2017

Percona announces the release of Percona Monitoring and Management |release|.

|qan| is now integrated into |grafana| as a separate dashboard. This new design
has all the features that |qan| offered when it was a |pmm| module. 

With this release, |pmm.name| introduces a new deployment option: Amazon Market place.

In this release, |grafana| and |prometheus| have been upgraded. |pmm|
now includes |grafana| 4.6.1.  One of the most prominent features that the
upgraded |grafana| offers is the support of annotations. You can mark a point or
select a region in a graph and give it a meaningful description. For more
information, see `the release highlights
<http://docs.grafana.org/guides/whats-new-in-v4-6/>`_.
